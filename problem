(defproblem problem helloworld

  ; The initial facts of the world. This world has two locactions connected together. "Me" (the agent
  ; in this world) starts in one location and the person you're supposed to say "hello" to is in another.
  ; Note that HTN domains don't have to be about explicit agents in worlds. For example, the
  ; blocks world and freecell domains don't have a represented agent in a world - instead there is a
  ; world containing a "problem" which the system is trying to solve.
  
  ; There are two different problem definitions below. You can comment in one and comment out the other 
  ; to solve the two different problems. You can of course define your own problems in this file as well. 

  ; This smaller problem definition works fine in buggy version of helloworld.

  ; This bigger problem definition doesn't work in the buggy version of helloworld.

   ; The method to start with. The say method takes as an argument word to say and the person to say
   ; it to. The method finds a path to the person and then it says the word to them.
